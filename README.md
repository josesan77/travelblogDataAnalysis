# travelblogDataAnalysis
web-course on DataScience: solution

The excercise was to analyse the data of a digital nomade's web site related to the reads of the posts, the behaviour of the visitors, the conversion from visitor to returning reader then to subscriber and finally a customer who bought some of the services offered by the traveller.

Data (is not shown) in the followings is altered not to be recognisable.

Aim were to count the people at each above defined level, compare the levels in the funnel (analysis).
Besides to get some information on income and expenses.
Make decisions which group of users to keep (or to concentrate on) and which group may be neglected.
Of course there are country/continent based topics as it is a travel blog so the question was also to define which continent brings the most readers, so which topic is the most fruitful for the future of the travel blog.

Suggestions were made based on the analysis results (here those are not shown).
